We will be using Spring (specifically Spring MVC and Spring Boot) as the main framework, but we will not go into 
the details of this framework. This will be in the Spring block.

The main task of this block is to understand the architecture of web applications.

We will develop the "Dream Job" application.

There will be two models in the system: vacancies and candidates. Candidates will post resumes. HR will publish 
job vacancies.

Candidates can apply for a job. The personnel officer can invite a candidate for a vacancy.
